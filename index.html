        <h3>Muhoozi’s Tweets: Inside Uganda’s Strategic Alignment with Tshisekedi over Kabila</h3>
        <img width="100%" height="405" src="https://cdn-network.chimpreports.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cafc22f8-aace-46b4-8df0-a41a1d8337c5-780x405.jpeg"/>
        <p>Uganda’s Chief of Defence Forces, Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba, has taken an unusually direct stance on the political future of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), declaring that former President Joseph Kabila must not return to power.</p>
          <p>In a series of forceful tweets on Friday, Muhoozi openly endorsed President Félix Tshisekedi, underscoring Uganda’s growing interest in DRC’s stability and economic partnership.
          <p>“I will not let Joseph Kabila become a President of DRC again! You can forget about that,” Gen. Muhoozi tweeted.
          He further criticized Kabila for allowing the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan-originated rebel group, to entrench themselves in eastern Congo for nearly two decades, saying, “Kabila allowed ADF to subsist in Eastern DRC for 17 years. He never allowed us to take action against them. H.E. Tshisekedi is much better than him in that respect.”
          Muhoozi concluded with a powerful endorsement: “My big brother, H.E. Felix Tshisekedi, is President of DRC and I will support him as much as possible.”
          His remarks come at a delicate moment, just hours after the governments of Rwanda and DRC signed a U.S.-brokered Declaration of Principles for Peace in Washington, D.C., witnessed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
    The agreement commits both countries to mutual respect for sovereignty, regional integration, and efforts to dismantle armed groups operating along their shared borders.
          Uganda-DRC ties </p>
         <p>According to the Bank of Uganda, DRC is now Uganda’s second-largest export destination after Kenya.
         In 2023 alone, Uganda exported goods worth over $500 million to its western neighbor, with unofficial cross-border trade pushing the total close to $700 million.
          Major exports include cement, iron and steel products, foodstuffs, and petroleum.</p>
         <p>The integration of DRC into the East African Community (EAC) in 2022 further accelerated cross-border commerce, with infrastructure investments such as the Mpondwe One-Stop Border Post and road construction projects linking Uganda to key eastern Congolese towns.
         Maintaining peace and fostering close ties with Kinshasa is therefore crucial to sustaining Uganda’s economic growth.
        Tshisekedi’s tenure has been markedly different from Kabila’s in terms of security cooperation.
         Under Tshisekedi, Uganda launched “Operation Shujaa,” a joint military offensive with Congolese forces aimed at dismantling the ADF in eastern Congo—something Kabila’s administration consistently obstructed under the pretext of protecting Congolese sovereignty.
         Moreover, the DRC government has in recent years accused figures linked to Joseph Kabila of supporting armed groups such as the M23 and the newly formed Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC), both of which have destabilized the eastern provinces and threatened Uganda’s trade corridors.
         UN reports and Congolese intelligence suggest that some of these groups were bolstered by networks associated with the former president’s political circles.
         President Tshisekedi last year accused Kabila of being the ‘real leader’ of AFC rebel movement which formed an alliance with M23 insurgents to wage war against his government.
         Kabila, who lives in Southern Africa, recently visited Goma, a city in Eastern DRC under the control of AFC/M23 rebel movement.</p>
        <p>He was quoted as saying he felt “safe” being in Goma than elsewhere in DRC, signaling his close ties to the rebel movements controlling the region.
        Return of Kabila 
        Reinstating Kabila, therefore, could risk reigniting insecurity along Uganda’s borders, undermining trade, and reversing hard-won security gains.
        By publicly denouncing Kabila and endorsing Tshisekedi, Gen. Muhoozi is aligning Uganda with a regional stability agenda at a time when Congo’s neighbors and international stakeholders, particularly the United States, are working to forge durable peace agreements.
        His remarks also serve to reassure Kinshasa of Uganda’s loyalty, at a time when competing regional interests threaten to fracture alliances.
        Big market</p> 
        <p>Beyond security, the stakes for Uganda are profoundly economic.
        Eastern Congo offers one of the largest underexploited markets for Ugandan goods, and stability in the region promises opportunities for investment in agriculture, energy, construction, and logistics.
        Aligning with President Tshisekedi’s administration not only secures these economic interests but also positions Uganda favorably in the broader regional integration agenda.</p> 
        <p>Analysts will most likely concur that Gen. Muhoozi’s tweets, while unusually blunt for a senior military figure, reflect a calculated strategic message: Uganda’s future lies in deepening ties with legitimate, stable leadership in the DRC.
         It is possibly the clearest signal that Kampala intends to stand with allies of stability, economic cooperation, and international peace efforts—while distancing itself from political actors accused of fueling conflict and instability in one of Africa’s most resource-rich yet volatile regions.
        As DRC heads toward its next political transition, the battle for its future leadership will carry immense implications not just for Congolese citizens but also for the broader East African region.  </p>

        <h3>Uganda Qualify for 2025 Rugby Africa Women’s Cup</h3>
        <img width="750" height="405" src="https://cdn-network.chimpreports.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250419_222727-750x536-1-750x405.jpg"/>
        <p>
          Uganda’s Lady Cranes have officially qualified for the 2025 Rugby Africa Women’s Cup following a stellar display at the Rugby Africa Women’s Division One tournament in Côte d’Ivoire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their campaign concluded with a remarkable 63-7 win over Zimbabwe, a result that solidified their reputation as one of the fastest-rising teams in African women’s rugby.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tournament, played on a round-robin format, saw Uganda dominate the field, claiming victories over Zimbabwe, Tunisia, and the host nation, Côte d’Ivoire. Their ability to maintain high performance across all matches was a testament to their growing depth and cohesion.<!-- Either there are no banners, they are disabled or none qualified for this location! -->

          In their final match, Uganda’s forward pack laid a strong platform, enabling their fast and powerful backs to execute with precision. Their superior strategy and teamwork left no room for opposition, showcasing their control throughout the tournament.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier in the day, Tunisia wrapped up their campaign with a 34-0 triumph over Côte d’Ivoire, providing a fitting end to an action-packed week of rugby.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it was Uganda’s unmatched consistency and relentless determination that set them apart, finishing the tournament unbeaten and topping the standings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now set to join South Africa, Kenya, and Madagascar in the 2025 premier division, the Lady Cranes have re-established themselves as a formidable force in African women’s rugby — both in the 15s and 7s formats.
